# Python Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Python projects I've built while learning and applying software engineering fundamentals. The projects range from small automation scripts to larger applications involving APIs, databases, and backend development.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical problem-solving skills, clean code,and progressive growth as a Python developer.

## What This Repository Contains

Each folder inthis repositry is a standalone Python projectwith its own documentation and setup instructions.Projects focus on real-world use cases such as:

- Test and log file analysis.
- Data parsing and cleaning.
- API integration and data aggregation.
- Database-backed applications.
- Backend services and utilities.
- Automation scripts.

## Technologies Used

The projects in thbis repository primarily use:

### Core

- Python.
- Standard Python libraries.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

### Data & Processing

- Regular Expressions (RegEx).
- File I/O (CSV, JSON, text files).
- SQLite/SQL
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples).

### Networking and APIs

- HTTP requests.
- REST APIs.
- JSON data.
- Web scrapping.

## The Future of this Repository

This repository will get updated as I learn new technologies and build new projects.
